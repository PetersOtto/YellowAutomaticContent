# YellowAutomaticContent
This script can be use to create posts for the Yellow CMS blog. The images will be downloaded from unsplash.
I use this script, when I create themes for the Yellow CMS locally on my computer.
I am currently working with Ubuntu 20.04. I don't know, if the script will work on other operating systems.

## How to use.
All details you will find in the script file `yac.sh`.

1. copy the file `yac.sh` into your blog folder `(content/2-blog)`. 
2. open the file `yac.sh` with a code editor.
3. make your settings.
4. start the file with `bash yac.sh` in a terminal.

have fun!
